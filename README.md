    pip install pygame
```
To start the game
```
    python interface.py
```
If you are a Windows user just start this file in the folder : start.bat

## Documentation

The code is split in a rather intuitive manner:

- affichage.py : functions to display the game are
- entite.py    : classes for game entities
- collision.py : functions to handle collisions between every entities
- utils.py     : utils functions
- UI.py        : UI classes
- interface.py : the core game code
- levels.json  : the levels are stored in a json to facilitate adding some
- /image       : folder that contains the source for images and music

The structure of the levels.json file : 
The screen is 2000x1100
```json
    "level<int>":{
        "dialogue":[{
               "dialogue_gentil_1": "En effet, Aperture Science recompense ses",
